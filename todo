Design responsive and game-like UI
Implement designed UI
Add minimap on clients screens
Make sure two food isn't added at the same location
Add game options before start - world size and resolution, and game speed (food rate too?)
Add leave button to client

# Future
Add rocking-chair error to display in jurassic browsers such as IE (or just ones which don't support modules natively)
Make PeerJS a proper import in TS rather than patching types and assuming runtime presence
Implement a faster search structure than O(n^2) such as finding locations which have something present
